# databaseproject
#### Kaylee Moore and Jack Lindner

This CS 461 Final Project is our Game Rental Database system. The database has five tables linked together using keys,
as well as a GUI to display and modify, delete, or add entries.

To run this database program, simply run the DatabaseUI.java file. This will output whether the connection to the
database was successful, then displaying a GUI with entries and buttons.
